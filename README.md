## Task Components

The ETL project that you are currently viewing comprises the following key components:

a) This ReadMe file, a document which:
    
    - Outlines the groups' key objectives. 
    - Explains each key step that the group undertook throughout the project.
    - Showcases the group's findings.


b) ETL.ipynb, a jupiter file which:

    - Reads the source data.
    - Transforms the source data to orderly, clean and useable dataframes.
    - Exports the cleaned data to a Relational Database in PostGres.

c) Schemata.sql, a document which:

    - Builds tables withing the Relational Database in PostGres.
    - Established primary keys.

d) An 'images' folder, which contains scatterplots comparing:

    - A country's cost of living (including and not including rent) versus its GDP
    - A country's birthrate versus its GDP
    - A country's deathrate versus its GDP
    - A country's literacy rate versus its GDP
    - A country's infant mortality rate versus its GDP

e) A 'resources' folder, which contains the raw data.

    - Cost_of_Living_Index_2022.csv
    - countries of the world.csv

## Key objectives:

In completing this ETL project, our group sought to explore the relationship between a country's GDP and its birthrate, deathrate, cost of living, literatcy rate and infant mortality rate. We wanted to see whether the strength of a nation's economy was linked to higher quality of life for its people, and if so, how strong the link was.

We also sought to improve our extracting, transforming and loading skills. We committed to working collaboratively for as many of the task's technical elements as possible so that each of us could engage with ALL of the coding. Working this way also meant that we could develop our practice by observing the work of others within the team when they had more refined skills in a cetain area. We avoided, for as long as was reasonable, splitting the task into discrete components and sending individuals off with a tightly defined roles that no-one else would be involved in completing. The purpose of this project, afterall, was to learn.

## Data Sources

We started by brainstoring realtionship that we wanted to explore.
Once we had established a wishlist of sorts, we visited Kaggle.com to determine whether data sets existed for the variables in the aforementioned relationships.
We were pleased to find that data sets DID exist.

    - Cost_of_Living_Index_2022.csv
    - countries of the world.csv

We promptly downloaded them and began designing a relational database to house the data.
