There is a difference between cost of living and standard of living. The cost of living is used to measure how a common man can afford his regular needs to survive in that city. It is linked to the wages, the higher expense is to live in the city and the higher wages scale is applied. 
In contrast, the standard of living refers to the level of money and well-being, that people enjoy in a particular country. It is related to the quality of life.

We found that there is a moderate correlation between Global GDP and with cost of living index in many countries. The high level of GDP relates to the high level of living cost without rent index. 
The level of GDP measures economic growth, this might relate to inflation. Inflation increases the cost of living i.e. the employees' wages rise. Generally, the high level of GDP indicates the growth economy and impacts on the standard of living and other factors.
