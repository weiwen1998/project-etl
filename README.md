Inroduction

GDP is one the most important factors in literacy rate. Government expenditure in education(function of GDP) and foreign direct investments and openness to trade(contributing factors to GDP) have positive relationships with literacy rates. This means that as the GDP per capita grows so does the literacy rate and vice versa.


Insight 1

As is demonstrated in the graph, there is a positive non-linear relationship between GDP(per capita) and literacy rate.
It can be concluded that higher GDP would result in higher literacy rate. Therefore, to acheive a higher literacy rate, governments can take proper initiatives such as consistent increase in the education sector share of the budget, making primary/secondary education compulsory and developing educational infrastructures. 

These measures will lead to growth in GDP per capita, and ultimately resulting in overall development of the country.


Insight 2

It can be observed, as is expected due to the exponentional(non-linear) regression between GDP and Literacy rate, that the behavior of the graph changes.At a certain point, GDP growth accelarates whereas there is minimal change in literacy rate.
This can be due to the fact that although literacy rate is a basic effective factors in GDP growth, it is only one of many. In fact, even though literacy rate is vital to GDP, other factors start to gain significant importance at a certain point, namely good govenrnance, democratic indexes, political, economic and social freedoms, openness to trade and foreign direct investment.

To conclude, this analysis suggests that, along with investment in education, governments pursue political, economic and social development, enhance democratic indexes, and absorb foreign investments to increase GDP.

##Comparison of GDP vs Infant Mortality Rate

Based on the graph given, there is an indication of a negative gradient, which explains that for every $1 increase in the GDP, would lead to a decrease in the expected value of the Infant Mortality Rate of the country by 0.0016 deaths per 1000 births, ceteris paribus.

This indicates that when the country has a higher GDP, the infant mortality rate is considerably lower and vice versa. 

The graph indicates that the majority of the countries have an infant mortality rate that lies in between the range of 0 to 40 deaths per 1000 births. These depend on a variety of conditions including living standards and conditions, birth issues and many more.


#Comparison of GDP vs Death Rate

We can observe from the graph that the negative gradient indicates that the GDP would decrease if the death rate would increase.

The death rate of most of the countries lies in between 5 to 10, and this could be due to global disease pandemics like AIDS and the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected many countries and more people have died from the complications of this virus. 

Some of the countries have a high death rate as a result of low GDP be the case is due to the issues that some of these countries are facing, including issues with famine, lack of safe water and water-borne diseases (diarrhoea, typhoid, hookworm and schistosomiasis), sanitation issues, showing the effect and evidence of the negative trend.


#Comparison of GDP vs Birth Rates

We can observe from the graph that the negative gradient indicates that the GDP would decrease if the birth rate would increase.

This could be due to a variety of factors, since countries with a higher GDP would have more commitments to deal with, compared to those with lower GDP levels like work and educational and other factors like markets, financial ability and social security.
