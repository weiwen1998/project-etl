Inroduction

GDP is one the most important factors in literacy rate. Government expenditure in education(function of GDP) and foreign direct investments and openness to trade(contributing factors to GDP) have positive relationships with literacy rates. This means that as the GDP per capita grows so does the literacy rate and vice versa.


Insight 1

As is demonstrated in the graph, there is a positive non-linear relationship between GDP(per capita) and literacy rate.
It can be concluded that higher GDP would result in higher literacy rate. Therefore, to acheive a higher literacy rate, governments can take proper initiatives such as consistent increase in the education sector share of the budget, making primary/secondary education compulsory and developing educational infrastructures. 

These measures will lead to growth in GDP per capita, and ultimately resulting in overall development of the country.


Insight 2

It can be observed, as is expected due to the exponentional(non-linear) regression between GDP and Literacy rate, that the behavior of the graph changes.At a certain point, GDP growth accelarates whereas there is minimal change in literacy rate.
This can be due to the fact that although literacy rate is a basic effective factors in GDP growth, it is only one of many. In fact, even though literacy rate is vital to GDP, other factors start to gain significant importance at a certain point, namely good govenrnance, democratic indexes, political, economic and social freedoms, openness to trade and foreign direct investment.

To conclude, this analysis suggests that, along with investment in education, governments pursue political, economic and social development, enhance democratic indexes, and absorb foreign investments to increase GDP.
