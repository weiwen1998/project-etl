##Comparison of GDP vs Infant Mortality Rate

Based on the graph given, there is an indication of a negative gradient, which explains that for every $1 increase in the GDP, would lead to a decrease in the expected value of the Infant Mortality Rate of the country by 0.0016 deaths per 1000 births, ceteris paribus.

This indicates that when the country has a higher GDP, the infant mortality rate is considerably lower and vice versa. 

The graph indicates that the majority of the countries have an infant mortality rate that lies in between the range of 0 to 40 deaths per 1000 births. These depend on a variety of conditions including living standards and conditions, birth issues and many more.


#Comparison of GDP vs Death Rate

We can observe from the graph that the negative gradient indicates that the GDP would decrease if the death rate would increase.

Majority of the countries have a death rate of between 5 to 10, and this comes into effect especially with the coronavirus disease impacting many countries and more people dying from the complications of this virus. 

Some of the countries have a high death rate as a result of low GDP be the case is due to the issues that some of these countries are facing, including issues with famine, lack of safe water and water-borne diseases (diarrhoea, typhoid, hookworm and schistosomiasis), sanitation concerns, showing the effect and evidence of the negative trend.


#Comparison of GDP vs Birth Rates

We can observe from the graph that the negative gradient indicates that the GDP would decrease if the birth rate would increase.

This could be due to a variety of factors, since countries with a higher GDP would have more commitments to deal with, compared to those with lower GDP levels like work commitments, education and other factors like markets, financial ability and social security.
